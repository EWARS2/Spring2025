The Konami code is the most well known instance of a "cheat code" in videogames. Originally intended to buff the player for testing Gradius on the NES, its popularity led to it being included in a handful of subsequent Konami releases (Most notably of which was Contra). From the titlescreen, you could enter it with the following sequence: Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start.

In an unrelated note, I think there should be a standard established for mapping a gamepad to a keyboard for emulation. For example, the left analog stick should map to WASD, and the right analog stick to the numpad. But what's probably most useful is the D-Pad mapped to the arrow keys, with ZXCV being for BAXY. Triggers should be mapped to Left/Right Ctrl and Alt. Start and Select should map to Enter and Right shift respectively. (Or maybe -/+ for mirroring Nintendo's design? Hmmm...) I hope that makes enough sense to solve this puzzle below...
